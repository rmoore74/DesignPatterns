# DesignPatterns
If there's one thing I've learned during my time whilst at SAP, it would be that of the importance of design patterns. Consequently, I purchased Head First Design Patterns and have decided to work through this to enhance my knowledge of these design principles and become a better programmer! I've decided that I may as well document my progress here on GitHub, as well as having a central repository that I can retrieve my code from.

**Chapter One** This chapter was the introduction to the book and was all about the strategy pattern. I learned that the strategy pattern is a great way to deal with the issue of maintaining object oriented code. For example, in this chapter we followed the project 'SimUDuck', where we created a base duck class that used behaviours to control whether a duck can quack or fly etc. We created each behaviour that we want to use and then we assign that when we instantiate an instance of an object that extends from the main Duck object. The benefit of this is not having to worry about overriding inherited methods or creating an instance of a method for each object that inherits from an interface.
